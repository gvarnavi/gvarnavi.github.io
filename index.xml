My research focuses on non-equilibrium transport in interacting condensed matter systems. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by the emergence of electron &amp;ldquo;hydrodynamic&amp;rdquo; behavior in ultra-clean (semi-)metals and developing new imaging modalities with which to observe the resulting non-uniform current densities.</description></item><item><title>Generative Art</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/generative-art/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/generative-art/</guid><description>Together with some friends from the department, I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching a generative art workshop during MIT&amp;rsquo;s Independent Activity Period (IAP) for the past 4 years. IAP 2022 will be the fifth iteration of the workshop (previously taught in 2017 and 2018 with Emma Vargo, 2020 with Amina Matt, Jovana and Nina Andrejevic, and 2021 with Jovana and Nina).
The 4-day workshop walks through python and Wolfram Language notebooks, covering the following broad topics:</description></item><item><title>Yoga Poses Constellations</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/yoga-poses-constellations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/yoga-poses-constellations/</guid><description>At its first meeting in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), officially adopted the list of 88 constellations that we use today. These include 14 men and women, 9 birds, two insects, 19 land animals, 10 water creatures, two centaurs, one head of hair, a serpent, a dragon, a flying horse, a river and 29 inanimate objects. As many of us have (frustratingly) witnessed first hand while star-gazing - most of these bear little resemblance to their supposed figures.</description></item><item><title>Electron Hydrodynamics</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/electron-hydrodynamics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/electron-hydrodynamics/</guid><description>In most conductors at room-temperature, electron collisions are akin to billiard balls, resulting in the macroscopic observation of diffusive flow (Ohm&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;). Recently, spatially-resolved transport measurements have revealed electrons in strongly-interacting materials can behave akin to classical fluids, confirming theoretical predictions over fifty years old.
I study these &amp;ldquo;hydrodynamic&amp;rdquo; electron flows across various length scales, from their microscopic origins, to their macroscopic observables. I was recently part of a team which imaged these flows in a 3D conductor for the first time, corroborating a newly-proposed electron interaction mechanism by us mediated by lattice vibrations.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Characterization</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/advanced-characterization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/advanced-characterization/</guid><description>I have long been fascinated by materials characterization, and in-particular the ability to image atoms and nanoscale phenomena at high spatial resolution. In many scenarios, the best way to do that is using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
In my work, I have collaborated with experimentalists to directly image moir√® superlattices at the interface of 2D/3D materials and investigate phonon localization at the interface between two 2D materials with high-resolution (S)TEM-based techniques.</description></item><item><title>Spatially Resolved Transport</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/spatially-resolved-transport/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/spatially-resolved-transport/</guid><description>During the course of my PhD, I have developed an open-source software package called SpaRTaNS to perform spatially-resolved transport by solving the steady-state Boltzmann transport equation in three real-space and three momentum-space dimensions.
SpaRTaNS is &amp;ldquo;carrier-agnostic&amp;rdquo;, and so far we have used it to investigate thermal interface resistance of semi-coherent interfaces and the importance of microscopic interactions in electron hydrodynamic flows.</description></item><item><title>Materials Science Pedagogy</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/materials-science-pedagogy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/materials-science-pedagogy/</guid><description>I spend some of my time thinking about pedagogy and the role visualization and computation can play in education. Currently, I am co-authoring a materials science textbook with long-time friend and mentor W. Craig Carter. The idea is to use some of the content we&amp;rsquo;ve developed teaching through the years, into a cohesive collection of computational notebooks which would guide undergraduate and first-year graduate students in materials science and engineering programs.</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
