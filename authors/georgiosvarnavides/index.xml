One of the earliest and most successful algorithms for such phase retrieval is based on projection onto (non-)convex sets, which turns out to also be able to solve a variety of non-convex problems. Perhaps the most fun application is solving a Sudoku puzzle.</description></item><item><title>Counting Digits of Pi</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/counting-digits-of-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/counting-digits-of-pi/</guid><description>Introduction As part of the MIT course 3.029 I taught in the spring of 2022, we held optional coding &amp;ldquo;get-togethers&amp;rdquo; once a week, alternating between &amp;ldquo;Data-Visualization Hour&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Code Show and Tell&amp;rdquo;. In particular, the week of Pi day happened to fall on &amp;ldquo;Code Show and Tell&amp;rdquo; and the students thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to code up one of the craziest Pi-related phenomena I know.
This is very beautifully explained in the 3Blue1Brown video below:</description></item><item><title>Generative Art</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/generative-art/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/generative-art/</guid><description>Together with some friends in the DMSE department, I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching a generative art workshop during MIT&amp;rsquo;s Independent Activity Period (IAP) for the past 5 years. IAP 2022 was the fifth* iteration of the workshop (previously taught in 2017 and 2018 with Emma Vargo, 2020 with Amina Matt, Jovana and Nina Andrejevic, and 2021 with Jovana and Nina).
The 4-day workshop walks through python and Wolfram Language notebooks, covering the following broad topics:</description></item><item><title>Geograghic Map Distortions</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/geographic-map-distortions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/geographic-map-distortions/</guid><description>I’ve long been fascinated with transportation maps, and in particular the revolutionary re-design of the london-underground map by Harry Beck in 1933. In his iconic design, which has since been adopted by most transportation maps, Harry Beck deliberately sacrifices geographic accuracy for visual clarity of information - by using equally-spaced stations on straight lines with only 45/90 degree bends.
In this Wolfram Community post, we investigate how the local coordinate system is additionally distorted through the years as more stations get added to display the information more clearly.</description></item><item><title>Yoga Poses Constellations</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/yoga-poses-constellations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/musings/yoga-poses-constellations/</guid><description>At its first meeting in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), officially adopted the list of 88 constellations that we use today. These include 14 men and women, 9 birds, two insects, 19 land animals, 10 water creatures, two centaurs, one head of hair, a serpent, a dragon, a flying horse, a river and 29 inanimate objects. As many of us have (frustratingly) witnessed first hand while star-gazing - most of these bear little resemblance to their supposed figures.</description></item><item><title>Electron Hydrodynamics</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/electron-hydrodynamics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/electron-hydrodynamics/</guid><description>In most conductors at room-temperature, electron collisions are akin to billiard balls, resulting in the macroscopic observation of diffusive flow (Ohm&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;). Recently, spatially-resolved transport measurements have revealed electrons in strongly-interacting materials can behave akin to classical fluids, confirming theoretical predictions over fifty years old.
I study these &amp;ldquo;hydrodynamic&amp;rdquo; electron flows across various length scales, from their microscopic origins, to mesoscopic finite-size effects, and to their macroscopic observables. Recently, I was part of a team which imaged these flows in a 3D conductor for the first time, corroborating a newly-proposed electron interaction mechanism mediated by lattice vibrations.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Characterization</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/advanced-characterization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/advanced-characterization/</guid><description>I have long been fascinated by materials characterization, and in-particular the ability to image atoms and nanoscale phenomena at high spatial resolution. One of the most versatile instruments to achieve this is the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).
In my PhD work, I have collaborated with experimentalists to directly image moirè superlattices at the interface of 2D/3D materials and investigate phonon localization at the interface between two 2D materials with high-resolution STEM-based techniques.</description></item><item><title>Spatially Resolved Transport</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/spatially-resolved-transport/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/spatially-resolved-transport/</guid><description>During the course of my PhD, I developed an open-source software package called SpaRTaNS to perform spatially-resolved transport by solving the steady-state Boltzmann transport equation in three real-space and three momentum-space dimensions.
SpaRTaNS is &amp;ldquo;carrier-agnostic&amp;rdquo; with applications in phonon (heat) transport (e.g thermal interface resistance of semi-coherent interfaces), as-well as electron (charge) transport (e.g the importance of microscopic interactions in electron hydrodynamic flows). SpaRTaNS can be run on anything from a laptop to high-performance computing systems, and provides a flexible API for specifying custom boundary conditions, collision operators, geometries, state spaces, and more.</description></item><item><title>Materials Science Pedagogy</title><link>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/materials-science-pedagogy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gvarnavi.github.io/research-topics/materials-science-pedagogy/</guid><description>I spend a great deal of my time thinking about pedagogy and the role visualization and computation can play in education. Currently, I am co-authoring an open-source materials science textbook with long-time friend and mentor Prof. W. Craig Carter. The idea is to curate some of the content we&amp;rsquo;ve developed teaching through the years, into a cohesive collection of computational notebooks which would guide undergraduate and first-year graduate students in materials science and engineering programs.</description></item></channel></rss>
