In many scenarios, the best way to do that is using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
In my work, I have collaborated with experimentalists to directly image moir√® superlattices at the interface of 2D/3D materials and investigate phonon localization at the interface between two 2D materials with high-resolution (S)TEM-based techniques.</description></item></channel></rss>
