Recently, spatially-resolved transport measurements have revealed electrons in strongly-interacting materials can behave akin to classical fluids, confirming theoretical predictions over fifty years old.
I study these &amp;ldquo;hydrodynamic&amp;rdquo; electron flows across various length scales, from their microscopic origins, to mesoscopic finite-size effects, and to their macroscopic observables. Recently, I was part of a team which imaged these flows in a 3D conductor for the first time, corroborating a newly-proposed electron interaction mechanism mediated by lattice vibrations.</description></item></channel></rss>
