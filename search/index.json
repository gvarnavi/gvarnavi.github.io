In his iconic design, which has since been adopted by most transportation maps, Harry Beck deliberately sacrifices geographic accuracy for visual clarity of information - by using equally-spaced stations on straight lines with only 45/90 degree bends.\nIn this Wolfram Community post, we investigate how the local coordinate system is additionally distorted through the years as more stations get added to display the information more clearly.\n","href":"/musings/geographic-map-distortions/","title":"Geograghic Map Distortions"},{"content":"","href":"/publications/phys-rev-mater-5-l091202-2021/","title":"Phys Rev Mater 5, L091202 (2021)"},{"content":"","href":"/publications/nat-phys-17-1216-1220-2021/","title":"Nat Phys, 17, 1216â€“1220 (2021)"},{"content":"","href":"/publications/sci-adv-7-eabi6699-2021/","title":"Sci Adv 7, eabi6699 (2021)"},{"content":"","href":"/publications/arxiv2109.00550-2021/","title":"arXiv:2109.00550 (2021)"},{"content":"","href":"/publications/nat-commun-12-4799-2021/","title":"Nat Commun 12, 4799 (2021)"},{"content":"","href":"/publications/biorxiv2021.06.24.449506-2021/","title":"bioRxiv 2021.06.24.449506 (2021)"},{"content":"","href":"/publications/angew-chem-int-ed-2021/","title":"Angew.

These include 14 men and women, 9 birds, two insects, 19 land animals, 10 water creatures, two centaurs, one head of hair, a serpent, a dragon, a flying horse, a river and 29 inanimate objects. As many of us have (frustratingly) witnessed first hand while star-gazing - most of these bear little resemblance to their supposed figures. Instead, it is more likely that the ancient constellation-makers meant them to be symbolic, a kind of celestial \u0026ldquo;Hall of Fame\u0026rdquo; for their favorite animals or heroes.\nThis begs two questions I sought to answer with this old post of mine on Wolfram Community:\nCan we \u0026lsquo;do better\u0026rsquo; now with Wolfram Language\u0026rsquo;s StarData[] curated data and Machine Learning functionality?

Recently, spatially-resolved transport measurements have revealed electrons in strongly-interacting materials can behave akin to classical fluids, confirming theoretical predictions over fifty years old.\nI study these \u0026ldquo;hydrodynamic\u0026rdquo; electron flows across various length scales, from their microscopic origins, to their macroscopic observables.
